# Ecomm Website for Book_Shopping

The project is an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse and purchase products online. It is built using a microservices architecture, which is made up of distinct components, or microservices, that are connected by REST APIs. The same microservices on the back end can be used to create many user interfaces. Though the quirks of this architectural style fascinate development teams, the benefits to corporations are considerable.

The system has two types of users - admins and customers. Admins are responsible for managing the categories, products, orders, and payments, while customers can register, login, browse products, add items to cart, checkout, and track their orders.

The back-end is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS. The data is stored in a MongoDb.

Overall, the e-commerce platform is designed to be a scalable, robust, and secure system that allows customers to shop for products(Books) online with ease. The microservices architecture and use of DevOps tools ensures that the platform can be easily maintained and updated while minimizing downtime.
